INTRODUCTION:
	This is a basic game I made in High School.
	It was inspired from a hand game I used to play with my friends.

HOW TO PLAY:
	The left side shows the stats of the player while the right side shows the computer.
	Initially the player can choose only charge.
	The various moves you can do depends on the amount of charge you have.
	The shields have various power levels.
	A shield with power level x can protect you against an attack of a move costing charge x or less.
	Currently when you lose or win a game you have to manually open the Game.py file again. Maybe in the future I will add more moves and a play again functionality.
